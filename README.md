# conceptual_graph_set
A conceptual graph data-set for NLP/NLU serialised in JSON format

This is a data-set of [conceptual graphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_graph) which have
been obtained from RSS feeds from BBC, SkyNews, KnoxNews, USA Today and Science Daily.
The graphs have been manually transcribed and may contain a few errors (contradictions).

The POS tag field is empty on purpose, albeit an updated data-set with POS tags could be made available upon request.
This set has been used for dependency parsing (NLU) based on Semantics and Syntactics.
